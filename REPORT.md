# Engineering pilot report

## Reproducibility

- Benchmark seed: `1337`
- Tasks: `12` closed-specification expression repairs
- Conditions: `K/implicit`, `K/explicit`, `rich/implicit`, `rich/explicit`
- Turn cap: `6` per task/condition
- Adapter: bundled deterministic `baseline_agent.py`, **not a language model**
- Interpreter: bundled pure JSON-expression evaluator
- Current tests: **10 passing**, including local mock HTTP integration across all four conditions and a Kaggle task-generation test that checks isolated turns, public-only prompts, and usage accounting with a mock model
- Task inputs and hidden reference data: `tasks-v2.json` (public calibration data)
- Summary and complete per-run audit traces: `reports/calibration-traces.zip`, containing `runs-v2/summary.json` and `runs-v2/tNNNN/{condition}/trace.json`

## Smoke-test observations

| Condition | Hidden passes | Public passes | Protocol errors | Mean turns |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| K / implicit | 2 / 12 | 2 / 12 | 0 | 5.33 |
| K / explicit | 2 / 12 | 2 / 12 | 0 | 5.33 |
| Rich / implicit | 2 / 12 | 2 / 12 | 0 | 5.33 |
| Rich / explicit | 2 / 12 | 2 / 12 | 0 | 5.33 |

The adapter disregards the human signal and does not use the ledger or history when choosing edits, so identical outcomes in all arms are expected. This result verifies that all arms execute and that data can be collected. It **does not** test whether explicit state improves an LLM's autonomy.

An earlier, easier two-mutation task generator was solved in 11/12 tasks by the same deterministic adapter. Before any LLM trials, the generator was strengthened to depth-three expressions with four distinct mutations. Those earlier smoke outcomes are not pooled with these results.

## Remaining experimental prerequisites

1. Provision `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret or worker credential, then run the manually gated Kaggle exploratory workflow. The direct Chat Completions adapter remains an alternate route. Neither provider credential was available in the current worker.
2. Run adapters in isolation from hidden targets (the pilot has logical request separation but not filesystem confinement).
3. Fix a sample-size and random-seed plan; report paired confidence intervals rather than interpreting 12 tasks as conclusive.
4. Add a genuine resource-matched feedback budget; the rich reviewer currently reformulates available public evidence rather than providing new user information.
5. Add task strata for discoverable uncertainty and privately held preferences; the current task family tests only fully specified goals.
6. Check instruction adherence and state quality independently of final hidden-test success.

## Working conclusion

The four-arm control plane is implemented, executable, and traceable. Its direct model API path is integration-tested against a local mock server, and a Kaggle Benchmarks task is generated and mock-tested without requiring the Kaggle library locally. Neither route has completed live inference. The scientific claim remains **untested** until a properly controlled evaluation is run.

## Retrospective paired-analysis smoke check

The subsequent `analyze_trial.py` implementation was also exercised against
the archived `reports/calibration-traces.zip` (`runs-v2`, 12 complete task
pairs). The evidence digest for the extracted trace tree was
`7c9c5e66a2acdf343b2db607bd3b7c963ab4e5e850bba2454401bea4cfa35c39`.
It reproduced the 2/12 completions per arm. All three paired contrast
estimates were exactly zero. The conservative Bonferroni-Hoeffding lower bounds
were `-0.8261` (H3), `-1.6521` (H4), and `-0.8261` (H5); none crossed its
decision threshold. The legacy traces lack token-usage measurements, so the
analyzer correctly reports usage as unknown. This is **still only a deterministic
plumbing check**, not a model result or a preregistered trial.
